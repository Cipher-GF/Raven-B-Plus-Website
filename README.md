# Versions

Raven B+ is developed in multiple branches. These branches differ from each other, ranging from GUI changes, to entire modules. Some of these branches are more stable than others, or are more reliable / enjoyable to play with.

There are three main branches developed:

* Stable
* Experimental
* Beta

#### Stable

The stable branch is the original branch of B+, developed straight from Blowsy's original, Raven B3. It has improved upon Blowsy's modules, and added a few itself, such as Bridge Assist (Aiming to the block you are bridging to more reliably) and Hotkeys (Hotkey to specific items in your hotbar).

#### Experimental

This branch is further built upon the **Stable** branch. It has more advanced modules, such as a ghost block exploiter, which enables the user to spawn fake ghost blocks client side, and abuse them. This is one of the few modules that are included within experimental.&#x20;

#### Beta

Beta is still built upon Blowsy's original base, but it is overhauled. It includes an entirely new GUI, and a recode of some of the modules. This branch is semi-unstable, and is being developed to be different to the original B3 in more ways than just the modules.&#x20;

### What should I choose?

> Personally, I recommend the **Experimental** version. It has some really good modules, and is solid with no crashes.&#x20;

If you want to stick with modules over visuals, **Experimental** or **Stable** is the way to go.

If you favour visuals, Beta has a new GUI, which is more appealing then B+'s (The same as Blowsy's B3.)
