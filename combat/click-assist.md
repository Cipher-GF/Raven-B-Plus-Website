#### Assist \_\_ Click -&#x20;

This is solely for what system you are on. For Windows, stick to the "Before" option, and for Linux, use "After".

**Left Click -** Enables the module for the left mouse button.

**Weapon Only -** Only assists your CPS when holding a weapon.

**Only While Targeting -** Only assists your CPS when you are attacking a target.
{% endhint %}

This is the _percentage_ chance that it will click for you. The higher this value is, the more chance that the module will boost your CPS by simulating an extra click.

**Blocks only -** Will only boost your right mouse CPS when the player is holding blocks.
{% endhint %}
