# Auto Clicker

The auto clicker gives users an easy way to click, and a **significant** advantage in PVP.

#### Left CPS -&#x20;

How much the clicker clicks for you in-game. It deviates between the min and max settings, so make sure to make it believable - and humanly possible - on servers with good anti cheats.

#### Jitter Left -&#x20;

The clicker will imitate a jitter clickers hand movements, for a realistic imitation of real PVP. This is handy to bypass some anti cheat checks, but it's main purpose is to look legit for recordings.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Inventory Fill -** Weather to auto click in containers (Chests, inventory, etc)

**Weapon Only -** Makes it so the clicker only enables when the player is holding a weapon.

**Break Blocks -** Stops the clicker when attempting to break a block. (Recommended)

**Break Block Delay -** The delay between breaking a block, and resuming clicking.
{% endhint %}

#### Right CPS -&#x20;

The clickers right click CPS values.

#### Jitter Right -&#x20;

Imitating jitter, but for the right clicker as well.

#### Right Click Delay -&#x20;

When you hold down the right mouse button, you don't want the clicker to spontaneously start clicking 14cps for you. This is the case if you are trying to place one block, by just tapping the right mouse button.&#x20;

The delay waits until the mouse button has been held for a certain amount of time before activating the clicker.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Don't Right Click With Sword -** Weather to spam right click, when holding a sword and RMB is held.&#x20;

**Only Right Click With Blocks -** The clicker will only right click, when the player is holding blocks.

**Prefer Fast Place -** With this enabled, the client will prefer the Fast Place module over right clicking.

**Allow Eat -** Stop the clicker from clicking while the player is attempting to eat.

**Allow Bow -** Stop the clicker from clicking while holding a bow.
{% endhint %}

#### Click Style -&#x20;

There are two modes for this module:&#x20;

* RAVEN
* SKID

The RAVEN option, is Ravens randomisation for the clicker, while the SKID option is a skidded randomisation. They are simply different randomisations for the clicker.

{% hint style="success" %}
For Hypixel, both are equal. One will not flag more than the other, due to Hypixel having poor clicker checks.
{% endhint %}

#### Event -&#x20;

These are different ways of clicking. They both change when the click is simulated, and the timing.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For smooth Aim Assist, use **RENDER** event.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
