# Burst Clicker

This module is more of a feature, then something to be used. It simulates the act of drag clicking, which is used during god bridging, and reducing.&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

To use this module, bind it to a key. Then, once in-game, press the key bind and it will simulate the clicks as per the settings.

#### Clicks -&#x20;

The amount of clicks to be simulated. (This is not the CPS).

#### Delay -&#x20;

The delay between each click. The lower the delay is, the more clicks will be sent per second.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Delay Randomiser -** Adds some randomisation to the delay to attempt to increase its bypass.

**Place When Block -** When the player is holding a block, it will simulate drag clicks to the right mouse button, to place, instead.
{% endhint %}
