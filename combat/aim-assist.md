# Aim Assist

The Aim Assist module, helps aim towards an enemy. This is a major advantage.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

#### Speed 1 -&#x20;

One of the speeds used to aim towards the enemy. Aim Assist uses two, to avoid detections. These two are combined together, alternating, to prevent anti cheats from detecting a consistent aim change.&#x20;

They are different, so it requires some modifications and trial and error to find the speed you like.&#x20;

#### Speed 2 -&#x20;

The other speed used in the calculation of aiming.&#x20;

#### FOV -&#x20;

The module will only target players within your chosen FOV. This is to seem more legit, as normal players do not whip around when there is a player behind them, and lock onto them. It's also to help target the person you want to attack, while in a crowd.&#x20;

#### Distance -&#x20;

The distance that aim assist module works at. Players within this distance (and your FOV) will be targeted, and once they walk far enough away, will not be locked onto anymore.

**Click Aim -** Requires you to be clicking (or auto clicking) to aim.

**Break Blocks -** The clicker will stop clicking when you attempt to break blocks.

**Ignore Friends -** Players you add to your friends list will be ignored by the module. This is especially useful for Team games (where the teammates function does not work) or HCF.

**Ignore Teammates -** Will not target anyone on the same team as you. _Works on Hypixel._

**Weapon Only -** Will only activate the module if you are holding a weapon.&#x20;

**Aim Invis -** Will consider people invisible as targets. This looks a bit suspicious, as many legit players will not be able to target a invisible player effectively, but is an advantage.&#x20;

**Blatant Mode -** No matter what Speed 1 or Speed 2 is set as, will instantly lock onto the enemy. This looks suspicious, and is quite dangerous to use, as it has the possibility of flagging, and to other players, is obvious.

**Lock -** When an enemy is locked onto, the aim assist module will continue to aim at them even with other people walking across your FOV. This is _very_ useful for team fights where you are trying to focus on one person.
